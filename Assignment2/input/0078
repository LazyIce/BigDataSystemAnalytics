Aberavon (UK Parliament constituency) Aberavon (Welsh: "Aberafan") is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It returns one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system. It is represented by Hywel Francis of the Labour Party. History. The constituency was created for the 1918 general election by a division of the Swansea District. With the exception of the first term, it has been held by the Labour Party, and for seven years was held by Ramsay MacDonald, the Prime Minister in 1924 and from 1929 to 1935. In March 2014 Stephen Kinnock, the husband of the Danish Prime Minister, won Labour's candidacy. Given Labour's history of winning the constituency he is expected to join the British parliament, so the couple may become represented in the parliaments of two countries. Boundaries.
